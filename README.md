 * Time for the task was samothing like 2 hours approximately 
 * Task 6 wasnt so clear for me so i understand the question like this 
 I understood in section 6 that need to add a filter of result that you get part of the prodact
 so i add option to get prodact without title and without color and without price and without image
 * I try to keep the project as simple as i can 
 * If need i can uploade the website to mysql server to look on everthing working
